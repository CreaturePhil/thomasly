			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Asian American and currently in high school. I like to game a lot. My favorite games are Hearthstone, League of Legends, and Bind of Isaac. I bet I can beat you in any of these games if we were to battle against each other. In addition, I like to play Magic: The Gathering and read a good bit of shounen manga. My favorite mangas are Naruto and Bleach. Currently, I'm taking AP Calculus and is the best at it. I can find the maximum and minimum of many things in the physical world and used this to my advantage in winning many tournaments.</p>

			<h2>Best Player</h2>
			<p>Yup, that's me! I'm the god damned best player you ever will see. I can beat you in anything most likely. I can pull off anglebreakers on you all day in basketball or do some insane 190 km/h service aces on your ass. Furthermore, I can whip your ass in any game with my insane 4.01e-9 reaction speed whether it be LoL, HS, or BoI.</p>

			<h2>The Truth</h2>
			<p>That's not the real me. What you just read there were mostly all lies. I'm not the best player. I'm probably below average to be honest. The following posts below is what I have experienced the changed in me for the past years.</p>
